# Pok√©dex Challenge

## What's it?

This project aims to solve the following challenge:

Using the free [PokeAPI API](https://pokeapi.co), develop a dashboard composed of two distinct sections/screens.

**Home screen:**

On this screen, the user will be able to enter the name of the desired Pok√©mon. After insertion, the following data will be displayed:

Pokemon photo (sprite);
Pok√©mon moves;

**Second Section/Screen:**

This section will be dedicated to listing all Pok√©mon available in the API. Only the name and photo (sprite) of each Pok√©mon will be presented,
Navigation performed through pagination.

*Note: It is imperative that the dashboard design is clear and intuitive,
providing the user with a friendly experience during its use. In addition
In addition, ensure that all information is accurate and comes from
directly from PokeAPI.*
